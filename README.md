# Climate-Analysis-Dashboard
Built using Power BI


## Overview
Climate Analysis Dashboard is used to predict and analyse the weather condition with insightful visualization. The dashboard includes features like views of maps and checks the latitude ,longitude ,sunrise ,sunset ,humidity,temperature by region wise. Dashboard was developed using Power BI and Database is created with Postgresql and exported as csv file and further data loaded to Power BI . Visuals are created with python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for interactive dashboard.

## Features
  - **ArcGIS:** This feature allows users to view a world map within the dashboard and toggle between different regions to see the weather conditions for each specific area.
  - **Card visualization:** Provides the user better clarity on wind direction,sunrise ,sunset,celsius and humidity of particular region.
- **Matplotlib visualization:** visualize the scatterplot ,bar graph,line plot and pie chart of conditions
- **seaboarn:** visualize the heatmaps representation of condition.

## Technologies Used
- **Tools:** Power BI , Excel
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
